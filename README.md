# EmbeddedLab5
Lab 5 integrates two sensors and reads values from them using the ADC.
The first part of the problem was to use the internal temperature sensor from the MSP430 and read data from it utilizing the ADC. The second problem had to have the ADC read from two sensors, one of which was the internal temperature sensor, and the other the thermistor with a 10k ohm resistor.
